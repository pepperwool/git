## The recipe of choice

I chose this recipe because I like all kinds of egg dishes.

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in the bottom of a saucepan. Be sure not to crowd the eggs in the pan. They should fit comfortably.

4. Once the water comes to a boil, cover the pan with a lid and remove the pan from the heat. Do not lift the lid. Set a timer for the type of boiled egg you want, [from 4 minutes to 12 minutes.](#Cooking)

6. When the eggs reach the desired cooking time, use tongs to remove the eggs from the hot water and immerse gently into the prepared ice water to cool, about 10 minutes.
