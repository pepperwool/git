Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut? 

## What is Gumbo ?

***This Authentic New Orleans Gumbo is made with a dark roux, vegetables, chicken, sausage, and shrimp, and served over rice. This is a beloved recipe shared with me by a native New Orleanian.***

## Gumbo vs jambalaya:

**Jambalaya is primarily a rice dish (think paella) while gumbo is more of a stew that is thickened with a roux and made with chicken, sausage, and/or seafood. Both gumbo and jambalaya are often made with some similar meats and vegetables but the process of making them and flavors of the end result are completely different. Here is my favorite [Jambalaya recipe](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/one-pan-jambalaya/)!**

# ****Step-by-step Authentic Gumbo:****

**1. Make the roux. in a large pot, combine flour and oil and cook, stirring constantly on medium low heat.  You have to be careful to stir it constantly, on medium low heat, so that you don’t burn it. It’s easy, but takes patience. The darker the roux, the richer the flavor!**

**2. Chop the veggies.  When you’re ready to make your gumbo, start by chopping celery, onions, bell pepper, parsley.   I love the freshness from the green bell pepper, onion, celery and parsley. You can also add okra, if you want. Add it at the same time as the other vegetables.**

**3. Brown the sausage.   Spread the sausage in a single layer on a hot, large skillet.  Once  browned, flip each one over individually, to make sure they all get nice and brown on both sides.**

**4. Add to large pot.  Add chicken broth veggies, parsley, and roux to the pot and stir well.  (Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste.**

**5. Add meat.  Add chicken, sausage, and shrimp and taste.  Add more seasonings to your liking–salt, pepper, chicken bullion paste, garlic, more Joe’s stuff or more chicken broth–until you reach the perfect flavor.**

**6. Serve warm over hot cooked rice. This recipe tastes even better the next day as the flavors have a chance to blend. If you’re really wanting to go all out, serve it with a side of homemade [potato salad](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/traditional-potato-salad/)!**

# Ingredients

 For the Roux 

- 1 heaping cup [all-purpose flour](https://amzn.to/3WuUaqR)
- 2/3 cup oil (vegetable or canola oil)

****For the Gumbo****

- 1 bunch celery , diced, leaves and all
- 1 green bell pepper , diced
- 1 large yellow onion , diced
- 1 bunch green onion , finely chopped
- 1 bunch fresh chopped parsley , finely chopped
- 2-3 cloves [garlic](https://amzn.to/3CRtR7a)
- 1-2 Tablespoons [cajun seasoning](https://amzn.to/3Ey4ysz)
- 6-8 cups Chicken broth *
- 12 ounce package andouille sausages , sliced into 'coins' (substitute Polska Kielbasa if you can't find a good Andouille)
- Meat from 1 Rotisserie Chicken*
- 2 cups Shrimps , pre cooked
- cooked white rice for serving

# Instructions

1. **Make the Roux*:** In a large and heavy bottom stock pot, combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 300-45 minutes. This part takes patience! When it's finished, it should be as dark as chocolate (what is that?) and have a soft, "cookie dough" like consistency. Be careful not to let it burn! Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency.
2. **Brown the sausage.** In a separate skillet on medium-high heat place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate.
3. **Cook the vegetables in broth.** Add ½ cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot.
4. Add remaining cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley, garlic and roux to the pot and stir well.
5. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 15-17 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. (Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste.
6. **Add meat.** Add chicken, sausage, and shrimp.
7. **Taste and serve.** At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking--salt, pepper, chicken bullion paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth--until you reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day!)

Notes

**Roux:**

The roux can be made 3-5 days in advance, stored in a large resealable bag in the fridge.

**Cajun seasoning:**

My preferred brand is

[Joe's Stuff Cajun Seasoning](https://amzn.to/32pHQMw)

but I can usually only find it online. You could use any brand, but may need to adjust the amount added, to taste. You can also make your own

[cajun seasoning](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/cajun-seasoning/)

**Chicken and broth:**

The best way to make this gumbo is by buying a rotisserie chicken--removing all the chicken, and using the carcass to make homemade chicken broth. Then make the gumbo using the chicken and homemade broth. You can use store-bought chicken broth, but homemade is way better! Here's a

[tutorial](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/homemade-chicken-broth-how-to-get-the-most-from-your-rotisserie-chicken/)

for making it from scratch.

**Storing Instructions:**

Store Gumbo covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.

**Freezing Instructions:**

This recipe makes quite a lot, so save leftovers for another day!  To freeze gumbo, allow it to cool completely and store it in a freezer safe container (separate from the rice) for 2-3 months.  Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and reheat on the stove or in the microwave.
